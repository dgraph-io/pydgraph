    Nodes (vertices) from the query must have an ``id`` field in order to be recognized
    as a node. Optionally, if a ``type`` field is present (either as a list or a string),
    the type will be applied to the node. Attributes of nodes encountered in more than
    one place in the result dict will be merged.

    Edges are automatically extracted from the query result. If a node has an an id and a parent,
    a relationship is made. The relationship predicate name is assigned as the edge type.

    Note: this code is experimental and may change in the future.
