    "In this notebook we will use Dgraph database to store retail products information (Amazon products data) and Language Models to reply to users asking for a **product recommendation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language models are used in 3 different ways\n",
    "- we use LLM text analysis capabilities to craft a Graph database query to fetch the relevant information to generate a response. \n",
    "- we use a small model to generate and store text embeddings to find products, categories, brand, characteristics etc. based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- we use a LLM to generate a response to the use question based on the data retrieved in the Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a case of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and NLP (Natural Language Processing) leveraging graph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dgraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dgraph is particularly suited for knowledge graph and AI applications due to several key features and capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Database Structure: Dgraph is designed as a native graph database, which means it stores data in a graph structure consisting of nodes, edges, and properties. This is inherently aligned with the way knowledge graphs represent relationships and entities, making it easier to model complex interconnections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Native vector support: Any node may have any number of vector predicates which are indexed using HNSW algorithm for fast similarity retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: Dgraph is built to scale horizontally, handling large volumes of data and high query loads efficiently. This is crucial for AI applications that often require processing vast amounts of interconnected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Performance: Dgraph provides fast query execution and low latency, which are essential for real-time AI applications. Its performance optimizations, such as parallel query execution and efficient data storage, make it capable of handling demanding workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexible Schema: Dgraph supports flexible schema definitions, allowing for dynamic data models that can evolve over time. This is beneficial for AI applications where the data schema might need to adapt to new requirements or insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rich Querying Capabilities: Dgraph’s query language, DQL (Dgraph Query Language) is declarative, which means that queries return a response back in a similar shape to the query. DQL allows for complex graph traversals and pattern matching, which are essential for extracting insights and relationships in knowledge graphs. It also supports advanced features like recursive queries and aggregations and most importantly vector similarity search.\n"
